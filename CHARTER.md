# Ironrift
_Project Charter_  

### Objective
_Utilize the ECS game engine 'Bevy' and the safety-oriented language 'Rust' to create a mass-warfare first-person shooter game reminiscent of Star Wars Battlefront._  

### Details
I quite enjoy the original Star Wars Battlefront games, mostly for the sense of immersion when fighting alongside an entire platoon of soldiers. This is a style of gameplay I don't see very often and would like to see more of. _Ironrift_ will be set on a foreign planet using automated roboticized soldiers, that way I have freedom to ignore Earth's technological limits and so I don't have to model organics. The mechanics are simple but that won't detract from the gameplay.  

### Goal Timeline
* **Start**: 2021/02/28
* A usable game window: 2021/02/28
* [dead time -- figuring out design, superfelous projects]
* Load a map or two: 2021/04/07
* Physical player object and simple HUD (gun + text): 2021/04/15
* Physics (run/jump on map): 2021/04/25
* Pew pew and stupid NPCs: 2021/04/30
* Match logic: 2021/05/07
* Models and textures: 2021/05/14
* Menus, polish, optionally sounds: 2021/05/21
* **Launch**: 2021/05/22

### Requirements
* _Ironrift_ will be developed and tested using _Visual Studio Code_, the _rustc_ toolchain, and _Bevy_.
* Assets for _Ironrift_ will be created with _Blender_ (models), _GIMP_ (textures), and potentially _Audacity_ (sounds).
* _Ironrift_ will be playable on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.  

### Risks
* Learning Rust and Bevy as I go. Learning new programming languages is easy, but learning new tools is it's own challenge. Much of the adjustment to Bevy will be conforming to the ECS paradigm.
* Time consumed by alternate superfelous projects.
* Perfectionism.
* Bevy lacking necessary features (unlikely).
